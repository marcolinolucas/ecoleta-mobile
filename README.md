## üöÄ How to Start <a name="howToStart" />

First you need to [clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository.

With the code in your machine, you'll open the terminal and will install all dependencies.

``` npm i ```

The last thing you'll need to do is start the server.

``` npm run start ```

Now all is working. Congratulations!
